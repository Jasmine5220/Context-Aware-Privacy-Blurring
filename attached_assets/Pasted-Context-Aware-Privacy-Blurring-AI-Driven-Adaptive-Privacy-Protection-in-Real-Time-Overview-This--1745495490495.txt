Context-Aware Privacy Blurring
AI-Driven Adaptive Privacy Protection in Real Time

🔹 Overview
This system automatically detects and selectively blurs sensitive content (e.g., faces, documents, credit cards, license plates) in real-time. Unlike traditional tools that blindly blur objects, this system applies privacy filters only when necessary, maintaining both security and usability.

🔹 Key Innovations
✅ Context-Awareness
Understands why something should be blurred—based on scene context, app usage, or sensitive keywords.

✅ Hybrid AI System
Combines YOLOv8 (object detection) + Tesseract OCR + NLP for deeper understanding of content.

✅ Real-Time Processing
Ideal for video conferencing, banking apps, screen sharing, and more.

🔹 How It Works
Step 1: Capture and Preprocess Video
Captures video stream (webcam, screen, phone camera).
Applies preprocessing: grayscale, noise reduction, edge enhancement.
Step 2: Detect Sensitive Objects
Uses YOLOv8 + OpenCV to detect:
Faces
Documents
Credit Cards / IDs
License Plates
Screens
Step 3: Text Analysis
Extracts text via Tesseract OCR
Analyzes it using NLP (SpaCy/NLTK)
Looks for keywords: "VISA", "CVV", "Confidential" → blur it.
Step 4: Adaptive Blurring
Applies blur based on rules:
Gaussian Blur: documents
Pixelation: faces, card numbers
Edge-Preserving Blur: video calls
Flask-based API for rule customization per context/app.
Step 5: Return the Stream
Streams the processed video back in real time.
🔹 Use Cases
💳 Online Banking → Auto-blur credit card numbers
📞 Work Meetings → Hide papers, show faces
📸 Live Streamers → Auto-obscure private data on screens
🚘 Traffic Cams → Blur license plates
🏥 Healthcare → HIPAA-compliant document masking
